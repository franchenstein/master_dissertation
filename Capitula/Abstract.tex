Discrete dynamical systems are widely applied in a variety of scientific and engineering applications. System modeling involves performing statistical analysis of the system output to estimate the parameters of a model so it can behave similarly to the original system. These models can be used for simulation, performance analysis or fault detection. The current work presents new algorithms to model discrete dynamical systems using Probabilistic Finite State Automata (PFSA) by analyzing sequences generated by the original system and applying statistical methods and graph minimization techniques to obtain compact and efficient PFSA models. Its performance and time complexity are compared with other algorithms present in literature that aim to achieve the same goal.
