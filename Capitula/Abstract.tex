Discrete dynamical systems are widely applied in a variety of engineering and scientific applications. System modeling involves approximating system parameters by analyzing its statistics and using them to create a model that behaves similarly to the original system. These models can be used for simulation, reference or fault detection. The current work presents an algorithm to model discrete dynamical systems using Probabilistic Finite State Automata by analyzing sequences generated by the original system and applying statistical methods and graph reduction techniques to obtain compact and efficient models. Its performance and time complexity are compared with other algorithms present in literature that aim to achieve the same goal.
